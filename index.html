								<h2>From the Editor's Desk</h2>
								<h4><p>Come on, share that story</p></h4>
								<p>When was the last time you laughed or shed a tear, watching a movie or reading a great novel? Do you remember relating very strongly to a character in a moving story? Ever wondered why the human mind reacts emotionally to a story?</p>
								<p>For several years now, scientists have been trying to study the effect of stories on human neurons. The results are amazing: Tense moments in a story can produce the stress hormone cortisol, while happy endings can create dopamine which makes us optimistic and hopeful. Positive characters or actions in a story also produce oxytocin which leads to empathy and better understanding capabilities.  </p>

								<p>"The pulse of a person in health beats about seventy strokes a minute, and
								the ordinary term of life is about seventy years. In these seventy years,
								the pulse of a temperate person beats two billion five hundred and
								seventy-four million four hundred and forty thousand times. If no actual
								disorganization should happen, a drunken person might live until his pulse
								beat this number of times; but by the constant stimulus of ardent spirits,
								or by pulse-quickening food, or tobacco, the pulse becomes greatly
								accelerated, and the two billion five hundred and seventy-four million
								four hundred and forty thousand pulsations are performed in little more
								than half the ordinary term of human life, and life goes out in forty or
								forty-five years, instead of seventy. This application of numbers is given
								to show that the acceleration of those forces diminishes the term of human
								life."</p>

								<h2>Why we die</h2>
								<p>But few of the human race die of old age. Besides the thousand and one
								diseases flesh is heir to, and the disease which Mrs. O'Flannagan said her
								husband died of, viz., "Of a Saturday 'tis that poor Mike died," very many
								die of disappointment. More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, "It is the
								fretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear."</p>

								<p>"Choked with passion" is no chimera; for passion often kills the
								unfortunate possessor of an irritable temper, sometimes suddenly. Care and
								over-anxiety sweep away thousands annually.</p>

								<p>Let us see how long a man should live. The horse lives twenty-five years;
								the ox fifteen or twenty; the lion about twenty; the dog ten or twelve;
								the rabbit eight; the guinea-pig six or seven years. These numbers all
								bear a similar proportion to the time the animal takes to grow to its full
								size. But man, of all animals, is the one that seldom comes up to his
								average. He ought to live a hundred years, according to this physiological
								law, for five times twenty are one hundred; but instead of that, he
								scarcely reaches, on the average, four times his growing period; the cat
								six times; and the rabbit even eight times the standard of measurement.
								The reason is obvious. Man is not only the most irregular and the most
								intemperate, but the most laborious and hard-worked of all animals. He is
								also the most irritable of all animals; and there is reason to believe,
								though we cannot tell what an animal secretly feels, that, more than any
								other animal, man cherishes wrath to keep it warm, and consumes himself
								with the fire of his secret reflections.</p>

								<h2>The honeymoon</h2>
								<p>The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.</p>

								<p>The Saxons long and long ago got up the delightful occasion. Amongst the
								ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and
								sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at
								weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the
								nobility sometimes for a month--"monath." The "hunig monath" was thus
								established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the
								honeymoon.</p>

								<p>Alaric, about the fifth century king of the Saxons and Western Goths, is
								said to have actually died on his wedding night from drinking too freely
								of the honeyed beverage,--at least he died before morning,--and it
								certainly would seem to be a charitable inference to draw, since he
								partook very deeply of the "festive drink." It was certainly a sweet
								oblivion, "yet it should be a warning to posterity, as showing that even
								bridegrooms may make too merry."</p>

								<h2>A drawing joke</h2>
								<p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly
								fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
								witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
								case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
								witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
								dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
								of the faculty.</p>

								<p>The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant
								experience of his skill. The husband of the "maid" accused her of
								flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the
								ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The
								wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,
								keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.</p>

								<h2>Commencing practice</h2>
								<p>From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon,"
								by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which
								the author terms "Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:"--</p>

								<p>"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and
								much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,
								the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,
								in what was then a fashionable up-town street.</p>

								<p>"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my
								few books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and
								then left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on
								the table, to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.</p>
